          Mixing data/index/schema changes in the same migration is unsafe!

          Instead, let's split apart these types of migrations into separate files.

          * Introduce schema changes with methods like `create_table` or `add_column`
            in one file. These should be run within a DDL transaction so that they
            can be rolled back if there are any issues.

          * Update data with methods like `update_all` or `save` in another file.
            Data migrations tend to be much more error prone than changing the
            schema or adding indexes.

          * Add indexes concurrently within their own file as well. Indexes should
            be created without the DDL transaction enabled to avoid table locking.

          If you're 100% positive that this migration is already safe, then simply
          add a call to `disable_safety_checks!` to your migration.

            class #{migration_name} < ActiveRecord::Migration
              disable_safety_checks!

              def change
                # ...
              end
            end
        MESSAGE
      end
    end
  end
