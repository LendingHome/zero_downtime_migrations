> Zero downtime migrations with ActiveRecord 3+ and PostgreSQL.

Catch problematic migrations at development/test time! Heavily inspired by these similar projects:

* https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations
* https://github.com/foobarfighter/safe-migrations

## Installation

Simply add this gem to the project `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem "zero_downtime_migrations"
```

## Usage

This gem will automatically **raise exceptions when potential database locking migrations are detected**.

It checks for common things like:

* Adding a column with a default
* Adding a non-concurrent index
* Mixing data changes with index or schema migrations
* Performing data or schema migrations with the DDL transaction disabled
* Using `each` instead of `find_each` to loop thru `ActiveRecord` objects

These exceptions display clear instructions of how to perform the same operation the "zero downtime way".

## Validations

### Adding a column with a default

#### Bad

This can take a long time with significant database size or traffic and lock your table!

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean, default: true
  end
end
```

#### Good

First let’s add the column without a default. When we add a column with a default it has to lock the table while it performs an UPDATE for ALL rows to set this new default.

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean
  end
end
```

Then we’ll set the new column default in a separate migration. Note that this does not update any existing data! This only sets the default for newly inserted rows going forward.

```ruby
class SetPublishedDefaultOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    change_column_default :posts, :published, from: nil, to: true
  end
end
```

Finally we’ll backport the default value for existing data in batches. This should be done in its own migration as well. Updating in batches allows us to lock 1000 rows at a time (or whatever batch size we prefer).

```ruby
class BackportPublishedDefaultOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    say_with_time "Backport posts.published default" do
      Post.unscoped.select(:id).find_in_batches.with_index do |batch, index|
        say("Processing batch #{index}\r", true)
        Post.unscoped.where(id: batch).update_all(published: true)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Adding an index concurrently

#### Bad

This action can lock your database table while indexing existing data!

```ruby
class IndexUsersOnEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_index :users, :email
  end
end
```

#### Good

Instead, let's add the index concurrently in its own migration with the DDL transaction disabled.

This allows PostgreSQL to build the index without locking in a way that prevent concurrent inserts, updates, or deletes on the table. Standard indexes lock out writes (but not reads) on the table.

```ruby
class IndexUsersOnEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :users, :email, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

### Mixing data/index/schema migrations

#### Bad

Performing migrations that change the schema, update data, or add indexes within one big transaction is unsafe!

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean
    Post.unscoped.update_all(published: true)
    add_index :posts, :published
  end
end
```

#### Good

Instead, let's split apart these types of migrations into separate files.

* Introduce schema changes with methods like `create_table` or `add_column` in one file. These should be run within a DDL transaction so that they can be rolled back if there are any issues.
* Update data with methods like `update_all` or `save` in another file. Data migrations tend to be much more error prone than changing the schema or adding indexes.
* Add indexes concurrently within their own file as well. Indexes should be created without the DDL transaction enabled to avoid table locking.

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BackportPublishedOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    Post.unscoped.update_all(published: true)
  end
end
```

```ruby
class IndexPublishedOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :posts, :published, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

### Disabling the DDL transaction

#### Bad

The DDL transaction should only be disabled for migrations that add indexes. All other types of migrations should keep the DDL transaction enabled so that changes can be rolled back if any unexpected errors occur.

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean
  end
end
```

```ruby
class UpdatePublishedOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def up
    Post.unscoped.update_all(published: true)
  end
end
```

#### Good

Any other data or schema changes must live in their own migration files with the DDL transaction enabled just in case they make changes that need to be rolled back.

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean
  end
end
```

```ruby
class UpdatePublishedOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    Post.unscoped.update_all(published: true)
  end
end
```

### Looping thru `ActiveRecord::Base` objects

#### Bad

This might accidentally load tens or hundreds of thousands of records into memory all at the same time!

```ruby
class BackportPublishedDefaultOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    Post.unscoped.each do |post|
      post.update_attribute(published: true)
    end
  end
end
```

#### Good

Let's use the `find_each` method to fetch records in batches instead.

```ruby
class BackportPublishedDefaultOnPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    Post.unscoped.find_each do |post|
      post.update_attribute(published: true)
    end
  end
end
```

### TODO

* Changing a column type
* Removing a column
* Renaming a column
* Renaming a table

## Disabling "zero downtime migration" enforcements

We can disable any of these "zero downtime migration" enforcements by wrapping them in a `safety_assured` block.

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    safety_assured do
      add_column :posts, :published, :boolean, default: true
    end
  end
end
```

We can also mark an entire migration as safe by using the `safety_assured` helper method.

```ruby
class AddPublishedToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  safety_assured

  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean
    Post.unscoped.where("created_at >= ?", 1.day.ago).update_all(published: true)
  end
end
```

Enforcements can be globally disabled by setting `ENV["SAFETY_ASSURED"]` when running migrations.

```bash
SAFETY_ASSURED=1 bundle exec rake db:migrate --trace
```

These enforcements are **automatically disabled by default for the following scenarios**:

* The database schema is being loaded with `rake db:schema:load` instead of `db:migrate`
* The current migration is a reverse (down) migration
* The current migration is named `RollupMigrations`

## Testing

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
